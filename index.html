    <h2>Key Features of Rust</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory Safety:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector, preventing common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Rust provides performance comparable to C and C++ by avoiding runtime overhead, making it ideal for systems programming and performance-critical applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Rust's fearless concurrency allows developers to write safe and concurrent code, making it easier to build scalable and multi-threaded applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Tooling:</strong> Rust comes with a rich set of tools, including a build system, package manager (Cargo), and a comprehensive testing framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Type System:</strong> Rust’s type system and pattern matching reduce the likelihood of runtime errors and make code easier to read and maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Rust has a strong and growing community with an extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it easier to find support and tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Rust for Modulo Server?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> The modulo server needs to handle numerous requests efficiently, and Rust's performance characteristics ensure it can do so with minimal latency.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Rust's focus on safety and its ability to prevent many types of bugs at compile time means that the modulo server can run reliably with fewer runtime errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrency Support:</strong> The modulo server benefits from Rust's concurrency model, allowing it to handle multiple client requests simultaneously without compromising safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Rust's syntax and tooling make the codebase easier to maintain and extend, ensuring the server can evolve as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Was the Modulo Server Created?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Project VCHAT:</strong> The modulo server was created as a crucial component of Project VCHAT, providing a reliable backend to support the project's communication needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Easily Modifiable Source Code:</strong> The server was designed with modifiability in mind, allowing developers to easily adapt and extend the codebase to meet evolving requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>To Pass Time After School:</strong> The development of the modulo server also served as a productive way to spend time after school, honing programming skills and experimenting with new technologies.</li>
    </ul>
